                IT is the most important part of modern day business structure, it's what breaks down, tracks and
                streamlines business processes to make sure the business is working as fast and efficient as possible
                for
                maximum work output and maximum money income.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is ultimately the main goal for all businesses, because if the company wasn't running efficiently
                then the money income would suffer, which leads to lower wages or less staff and with lower wages or
                less staff the work output starts to suffer, which makes the money income suffer even more and the cycle
                will just continue until the company can't operate anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the modern software we have, it allows people to track just how efficient the company is running
                and
                also communicate to people instantaneously on what needs to be done or changed to make sure the
                efficiency continues or gets better.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.2</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                With the current technologies were able to use software like Trello to road-map and create an agile
                working environment which breaks down and assigns tasks to different team members while also keeping
                track of everything that's been done, needs doing and any other relevant ideas that might be
                incorporated
                in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't all we can do though, there are plenty of websites/social media sites can can be taken
                advantage of to promote, market and advertise the company, making sure that businesses are maximizing
                there reach and pulling in new customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my project I will be using PHPStorm as my Integrated development environment (IDE) as it's software
                specifically designed to write code files such as HTML and CSS, which is what I will need to make and
                design my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also a few different software businesses can used to make communication instant and as simple
                to understand as possible. This is a must as communication is the most important practise in modern day
                business and with classic techniques like email, text and phone calls mixed with new techniques used
                like Slack, Discord, Zoom, Google Hangouts and other voice and video call streaming software, it really
                simplifies communication between internal teams and external clients.

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                To plan out this project successfully, I will be using Trello to firstly write out all the tasks I need
                to complete and setup lists of "tasks to do", "tasks doing" and "tasks done". From here I have a really
                simple system where I can clearly see where I'm upto in my project and what still needs to be completed
                to finish my project off.
            </p>

        <h2>1.4</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                The first thing that comes to mind when i think about a failed project is either bad communication or
                lack of communication as this is the the most important thing when it comes to any successful project,
                but this isn't the sole reason for why a project could fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason could be lack of money for the project, meaning technologies might not be upkept, or
                there's not enough people on the project to work efficiently. There's also the fact that lack of funds
                could mean less of a pay check, which can drastically effect people's mentality leading to lack of
                productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leading on from the last point, lack of resources available for the project could really impact
                productivity, making it harder for the developers to complete their tasks leading to longer timescales,
                which could bring productivity to a complete holt further down the line.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most basic reasons could be due to bad planning and organisation or just straight up bad
                execution on the vision of the project. This could be down to managerial rolls not planning correctly or
                the developers doing a horrible job of working on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything mentioned above could be the single reason for a failed project, but most of the time it's
                actually a mixture of all of them, as most of these reasons are directly linked to each other.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.5</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                When it comes to selecting the right technology for my project, I picked the software I'm most
                comfortable using, which consists of Windows, PHPStorm and Trello with the help of the internet to look
                up anything I get stuck with.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I've used Windows is because it's what I've got most experience using, but also because it's
                the only Operating System (OS) I have access too.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to the right software to write the code, I went for PHPStorm over Visual Studio (VS),
                because I have more experience using PHPStorm and I've noticed that it has a few small features that VS
                doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also used Trello due to having to plan out and track everything I'm working on within the project and
                Trello is one of the best, if not the best, road-mapping website to update and keep track of a projects
                progress in a really simple way.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of other digital projects, it really comes down to what the project entails, for instance if
                it's a game project you would need to use a games engine software to have a structure to start with
                along with 3D modelling software to be able to create assets to be imported into the engine software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another example would be an admin worker, which would need software for typing documents or creating
                tables of data along with some sort of anti-virus software to make sure the data there collecting is
                safe and secure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.6</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                The technologies I've used to plan out and execute on my project have helped me by keeping things
                organised.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trello is very simple to use and easy to track how much work I've done and compare to how much work is
                left to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                GitHub has also helped a lot by being a simple to use platform that hosts the code for my website. It
                also uses GIT flow, which is really useful for updating my code by pushing it to my websites repository
                and manually merging them together to make sure I don't lose any code and ultimately break my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also handy how you can have different branches to develop different features at a time and add them
                when they are complete and need to be added.
            </p>

        <h2>1.7</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                GDPR was introduced in 2018 due to the massive amounts of peoples private data being stored on company
                servers without any regulation of how this data can be used or interacted with.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of companies would have this data and send it to other companies, usually for a payment, without
                the users permissions, which would lead to these third-party companies contacting the users and
                targeting them for marketing campaigns (commonly known as spam emails).
            </p>
            <p>
                Along with this, there were no regulations in place that allowed the user to determine whether these
                companies should even have there data stored and on the flip side there was no law stating that the
                company had to truthfully share what data they had linked to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the introduction of GDPR all Europian companies had to change their data policies to allign with
                this new law over the period of a few months.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way that this impacted companies intellectual properties, was by forcing them to add definitively
                clear to see messages that usually links the user to a page explaining exactly how there data is stored,
                updated and used along with how the user can contact the company to request either a physical copy of
                there data or to remove their data all together.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also impacted the way that data can be passed from one company to another, as the user would now be
                presented with exactly where their data was going and how it was going to be used, followed by the
                option to opt-in to allowing their data to be passed over to the corrosponding company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although data flow still works exactly the same, as it did before GDPR (with a few extra steps), the
                main differences are that the user can now understand how data flow works and opt-out of any personal
                data being transfered to somone or somewhere that they dont want to have access to their information.
