        <h2>3.1</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                Under the constraints of this project I believe I've been as efficient and productive as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trello was a massive help with productivity, as it helped me understand where I was in the project and
                what needed to be done next.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using PHPStorm over Visual Studio also reduced time taken to create my website due to little features
                that shave seconds off coding here and there which adds up over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could have also worked in a team with other people, which could have boosted efficiency, although
                productivity would have been reduced by casual conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally working in a team wouldn't have been efficient for me, because I'm used to working with HTML
                and CSS while also having a design vision, so having other peoples visions clash with mine added in with
                other people having issues with the code, whether that's understanding and/or writing the code, would
                have added more time onto the project and productivity would have taken a massive hit for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't to say I can't work in a team though, it's just on this specific project it would have been
                more of a disadvantage than an advantage to have a team, plus this is a personal project that I can use
                in future to prove I have the skills to create a website.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>3.2</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                For this project, if I could have used a material design styled css library it would have boosted
                efficiency ten fold, because it would have saved a lot of time on the css side of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                For any project though, being organised is key to productivity and efficiency along with good
                communication, as bad communication can cause more issues than solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being comfortable is also a big booster of productivity and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another massive thing that boosts productivity and efficiency is a willingness to learn, adapt and admit
                when you don't know something, so your not sat there too long trying to figure something out that a
                quick question or Google search could give you a better understanding of the subject.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>3.3</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                In terms of this project, I personally wouldn't have changed a thing!
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew exactly what to do and how to do it at all times thanks to Trello and my prior knowledge of
                website creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the project was more complex I would have worked with a team of people, communicating constantly
                through software such as Discord, Slack or Zoom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately the project was fairly simple and didn't require this though.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>3.4</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                To test digital solutions I would break down the process being tested, go through the logic of the
                process slowly and tick off what is working as I go along in my head.
            </p>
            <p>
                This should lead me to what is breaking the process, where I can then start coming up with or
                researching solutions for which bit of logic is busted and not functioning the way it should be.
            </p>
            <p>
                If breaking the process down doesn't lead me to the issue, then I would start researching the process
                overall to see if the process matches up with the logic of similar processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If researching isn't an option due to it being an original process then my last option would be to ask
                for help from another person who might have a better understanding of the subject matter.
