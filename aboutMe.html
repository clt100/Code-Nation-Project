        <div id="aboutMe" class="box">
            <p>
                My name's Conor, I've been working with computers since I was 5 and I've been doing graphic design since
                I
                was
                9. I first starting with pixel art, then moved onto learning how to use Photoshop at 12 along with video
                editing
                and 3D model creation which lead to me doing graphic design and games development in education.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I came out of education I continued doing graphic design only using my other skills every now and
                then.
                I
                then got a job where I worked as a graphic designer for a year and then started learning front-end web
                development on the job while still doing the graphic design on top.
            </p>
            <p>
                I now have a year and a half experience in front end web development/UI design/UX design. I plan to
                continue
                doing web development with graphic design and making it my career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                I came on the Code Nation course because I was struggling to find a job in these areas and I wanted a
                qualification to prove I could do what I say I can do along with the possible outcome of landing a job
                through
                Code Nation's help.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far it's mostly been easy as I already know a lot of the coding techniques and have experience using
                them,
                but there have been a few challenging parts when we built a JavaScript game and i found it really fun.
