        <h2>2.1</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                I'm really happy with the tools I've used for this project, Trello is great for organisation and
                PHPStorm is a great IDE and it's my preferred IDE due to some simple features it has that Visual Studio
                doesn't have.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also happy using GitHub and GIT flow as I'm already familiar with it and how simple it is to host my
                site and use version control so I have back-ups in case something goes wrong and breaks my site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zoom was also useful, as were in quarantine and were using it as a classroom environment, but also for
                the fact that if anyone needs any help they can unmute themselves and have upto 20 people at there
                disposal to help with any issues there having.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.2</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                The IT tools chosen for this project were perfect for me, Trello being easy to use and PHPStorm being my
                preferred IDE. Visual Studio would have been appropriate for the job, but I believe it's not quite as
                good, although it is free to use which is a bonus.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.3</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                I'm really happy with the website I've created for my final project, I believe it's visually appealing
                and functions exactly how a basic website like this should. I've even made custom imagery for the
                website, which makes it a little bit more appealing than just having the css.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I was to improve anything I'd start with making the css responsive for tablet/mobile using media
                queries and adding a sidenav for when it's viewed on tablet/mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I'd add a bit of JavaScript to make it a little more interactive and finally I'd implement
                FontAwesome icons to make it even more visually appealing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.4</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                If I wanted to improve my project even more I'd look at getting feedback from a focus group on the
                styling of my site and get them to test any features I have on my site and also look at cleaning my code
                up a bit more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd also look at adding more complex JavaScript like pop-up cards, sidenav, a fixed scrolling nav to
                scroll to specific elements etc.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.5</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                With my website project I have met all the requirements of the project guidelines and also the outcomes I
                planned to execute on, from having a functioning navigation bar to having custom imagery and all the data
                displayed in a nice and neat way using modern design techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                I even had a few extra ideas I could have added into the project, but the only problem with the extra
                ideas I had is that they would not have been fit for purpose as they would have involved JavaScript
                code, which is not needed in this project.
