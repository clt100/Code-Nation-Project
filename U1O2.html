        <h2>2.1</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                I'm really happy with the tools I've used for this project, Trello is great for organisation and
                PHPStorm is a great IDE and it's my preferred IDE due to some simple features it has that Visual Studio
                doesn't have.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also happy using GitHub and GIT flow as I'm already familiar with it and how simple it is to host my
                site and use version control so I have back-ups in case something goes wrong and breaks my site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zoom was also useful, as were in quarantine and were using it as a classroom environment, but also for
                the fact that if anyone needs any help they can unmute themselves and have upto 20 people at there
                disposal to help with any issues there having.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.2</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                The IT tools chosen for this project were perfect for me, Trello was really easy to use to track my
                project progress and PHPStorm, being my prefered IDE with over a years experience of using it, made it
                really easy for me to write and understand my code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visual Studio (VS) would have been appropiate for the job aswell, but I believe it's not quite as good
                as PHPStorm, although VS is free to use which is a massive bonus over PHPStorm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also used Google Chrome as the browser to view my files and my reasoning for this is due to the
                "Inspect Element" being a lot easier to use to add CSS to elements over other browsers Inspect Element
                such as Firefox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding CSS this way gives me a real time update of the code I'm adding, which makes the design side of
                creating a website super easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made sure to check other browsers to make sure the code appears the same way, because different
                browsers sometimes work different ways which can make one thing that looks fine on Chrome look
                completely different on Firefox for instance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.3</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                I'm really happy with the website I've created for my final project, I believe it's visually appealing
                and functions exactly how a basic website like this should. I've even made custom imagery for the
                website, which makes it a little bit more appealing than just having the css.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I was to improve anything I'd start with making the css responsive for tablet/mobile using media
                queries and adding a sidenav for when it's viewed on tablet/mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I'd add a bit of JavaScript to make it a little more interactive and finally I'd implement
                FontAwesome icons to make it even more visually appealing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.4</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                If I wanted to improve my project even more I'd look at getting feedback from a focus group on the
                styling of my site and get them to test any features I have on my site and also look at cleaning my code
                up a bit more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd also look at adding more complex JavaScript like pop-up cards, sidenav, a fixed scrolling nav to
                scroll to specific elements etc.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>2.5</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                With my website project I have met all the requirements of the project guidelines and also the outcomes
                I
                planned to execute on, from having a functioning navigation bar to having custom imagery and all the
                data
                displayed in a nice and neat way using modern design techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                I even had a few extra ideas I could have added into the project, but the only problem with the extra
                ideas I had is that they would not have been fit for purpose as they would have involved JavaScript
                code, which is not needed in this project.
