                The layout for each page on my site is the exact same, starting with a navigation bar at the top of the
                page,
                followed by an image section which has the title of the page on it and then I have all the answers to
                the questions from that section of the unit below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answers are split up by the number of the question formatted to the left, followed by a box with the
                answer to the corresponding question number.

                The easiest accessibility issue to address, when it comes to web-pages, is people with poor sight, which
                is an easy issue to fix as increasing the size of the text, increasing contrast and showing appropriate
                alt text for images. This is a fairly simple fix that many websites have as an option.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also another big issue with web-page accessibility that effects both visually impaired and
                non-visually impaired people the same. This issue is very common on websites and consists of too much
                text or too many links in a given space, which is often seen in the navigation section and/or footer
                section of a website. The easiest fix is good UX/UI design which splits the text/links up and is
                labelled in an appropriate and competent way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's just a couple of examples, but when it comes to website accessibility, it many comes down to the
                restrictions of the users ability to use a computer as a whole, as apposed to there ability to use the
                website alone.

                In terms of making a website, HTML (.html), CSS (.css) and JavaScript (.js) files are the most common
                files used for web coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although there are technologies these days that use specialised file types to make the human side of the
                coding easier. These files are then complied into .html, .css and .js to make them compatible for web
                use.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of uploading files to a website, the appropriate file types are controlled by the HTML code of
                the website so no malicious files can be uploaded.
