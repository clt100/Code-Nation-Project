        <div class="box">
            <p>
                The layout for each page on my site is the exact same, starting with a navigation bar at the top of the
                page,
                followed by an image section which has the title of the page on it and then I have all the answers to
                the questions from that section of the unit below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answers are split up by the number of the question formatted to the left, followed by a box with the
                answer to the corresponding question number.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.5</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                Copyright is a massive issue when it comes to online media, anyone with a little bit of knowledge can
                take text, images, videos and in some cases, website ideas/designs and modify them to be used in there
                own project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that companies have to consider when creating sites is making sure they have the right
                licences for the technologies used to build the website, because if they dont, then that is classed as
                illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
                GDPR also plays a massive role here, but I've explained that in an earlier answer and won't be covering
                it here.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I will be covering though, is in the past it was fairly easy to get away with plagiarism, in recent
                years there's really been a crackdown on stolen content, either from the owner of the content or
                third-party companies looking out for this.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a lot of websites now allowing people people to post any kind of media, it now also falls on the
                heads of the site owners as well as the person posting, but there is a way for companies to opt out of
                being responsible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing this, the control is more so in the users hands than the owners these days, so companies will
                right out terms and conditions were they will state that any plagiarised content or content deemed not
                suitable for the website can and will be taken down with the addition that there account may also be
                banned or removed from the website entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that companies have to hire someone to write out these terms and conditions, along with
                implementing a way to execute on these terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This used to mean that they would need to hire people to purely scan their websites 24/7 and remove
                stuff, but with recent technological advancements companies are now able to hire developers to design
                algorithms to do this job for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                An algorithm is basically an AI piece of software that follows specific guidelines and automatically
                produces outputs that a human would do, meaning a complete 100% reduction in people hired to purely scan
                through and remove posts/users from the companies site that are not welcome.

        <h2>1.6</h2>

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                The easiest accessibility issue to address, when it comes to web-pages, is people with poor sight, which
                is an easy issue to fix as increasing the size of the text, increasing contrast and showing appropriate
                alt text for images. This is a fairly simple fix that many websites have as an option.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also another big issue with web-page accessibility that effects both visually impaired and
                non-visually impaired people the same. This issue is very common on websites and consists of too much
                text or too many links in a given space, which is often seen in the navigation section and/or footer
                section of a website. The easiest fix is good UX/UI design which splits the text/links up and is
                labelled in an appropriate and competent way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's just a couple of examples, but when it comes to website accessibility, it many comes down to the
                restrictions of the users ability to use a computer as a whole, as apposed to there ability to use the
                website alone.

        <div class="box">
            <p>
                In terms of making a website, HTML (.html), CSS (.css) and JavaScript (.js) files are the most common
                files used for web coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although there are technologies these days that use specialised file types to make the human side of the
                coding easier. These files are then complied into .html, .css and .js to make them compatible for web
                use.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of uploading files to a website, the appropriate file types are controlled by the HTML code of
                the website so no malicious files can be uploaded.
